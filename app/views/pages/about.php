        This web application was built in April of 2014 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisham">Chris Ham</a> out of frustration with other conversion sites which don't take into account the density of the ingredient you're trying to convert from volume to weight.

    <p>
        The data used to drive this comes from
        <a href="http://blog.khymos.org/2014/01/23/volume-to-weight-calculator-for-the-kitchen/" target="_blank">a spreadsheet created by Martin Lersch</a>,
        who runs the <a href="http://blog.khymos.org/"  target="_blank">Khymos blog</a>.
